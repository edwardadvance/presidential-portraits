            <h2>Andrew Jackson (1829-1837)</h2>
            <p>Andrew Jackson, the 7th president of the United States, served from 1829 to 1837. Known as the "People's President," Jackson was a populist leader who championed the common man and sought to expand democratic participation. His presidency marked the rise of Jacksonian Democracy and was characterized by controversial policies, including the Indian Removal Act and his opposition to the National Bank. A war hero from the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812, Jackson's legacy is a blend of significant democratic reforms and contentious decisions that continue to spark debate.</p>

            <h2>Rutherford B. Hayes (1877-1881)</h2>
            <p>Rutherford B. Hayes, the 19th president of the United States, served from 1877 to 1881. His presidency is best known for ending the Reconstruction Era through the Compromise of 1877, which resolved the disputed 1876 election. Hayes advocated for civil service reform, equal treatment of all races, and efforts to reconcile a nation divided by the Civil War. Despite his single term in office, Hayes laid the groundwork for modernizing the federal government and fostering unity during a transformative period in American history.</p>

        <h2>George Washington (1789-1797)</h2>
        <p>George Washington, the 1st president of the United States, served from 1789 to 1797. Often called the "Father of His Country," Washington set the precedent for the presidency, shaping the office's role and powers. A revered leader during the American Revolution, he guided the nation through its formative years, emphasizing unity, neutrality in foreign affairs, and the importance of a strong federal government. His leadership and integrity continue to symbolize the principles upon which the United States was founded.</p>
